# Project-4--Regression-Data

Description
- The regression model is a supervise learning. this model used for prediction for continuous value based on correlation features.
- In this case, the model is designed to predict the Total Annotations added by a user. This feature is well-suited for regression, as it involves estimating a numerical outcome based on correlated input variables.

Objective
- Load data and study features
- Set Target and Features data
- Plot the Boxplot to visualize the outliers, remove the outlier data.
- Split training and test data
- Train Regression Model with Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Booster
- Predict the result with test data after train
- Evaluate the Model until get the best result
- Tuning/adjust the model
- Plot Residual Plot
- Plot Feature Important
- Plot Learning curve
